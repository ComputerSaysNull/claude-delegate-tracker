"""`plan_stack`: the ordering it derives, and the promise that it only ever reads.

The ordering is the part that can be wrong without saying so. Publishing is loud — a push
prompts, a check fails, a merge is visible — but an order derived wrongly rebases one
branch onto a sibling and invents history that nobody asked for, and the first sign is a
conflict several branches later in a file nobody edited.

`is_ancestor` is injected so the whole relation can be stated in a test without a
repository. The real caller passes `git merge-base --is-ancestor`.

The read-only tests matter for a different reason. This script exists because its
predecessor published from inside a subprocess, where the operator's hook could not see
it — `PreToolUse` only ever sees a command run as a tool call. Printing the commands is
what puts each one back in front of that prompt, and a `fetch`, a `checkout` or a `push`
added here later would quietly take it away again. The refusals below are asserted rather
than trusted, because a promise about what a script does not do is worth exactly what
enforces it.
