"""The amend handling was tested by planting the marker, never by amending.

`test_gate_judges_an_amend_against_the_right_parent.py` writes
`.git/docs-gate-reused-message` itself and drives the gate directly. That proves the gate
does the right thing *given* the marker, and proves nothing about whether a real
`git commit --amend` produces one -- which is the half that broke. It does not, for the
form that supplies a new message:

    git commit --amend --no-edit   -> prepare-commit-msg src="commit" sha="HEAD"
    git commit --amend             -> prepare-commit-msg src="commit" sha="HEAD"
    git commit --amend -m "..."    -> prepare-commit-msg src="message" sha=<none>
    git commit -m "..."            -> prepare-commit-msg src="message" sha=<none>

The last two are identical, so the third is judged against HEAD and blocks a commit that
did update its owning document. `GIT_REFLOG_ACTION` is unset in every one of them, and
reading the parent's argv from `/proc` -- which does work under WSL -- is unavailable
where these hooks run, because Git for Windows hands the hook a PPID of 1. All measured
on git 2.43.0, both platforms.

So this drives real commits through real hooks, and pins both the forms that work and the
one that cannot, so a future change is told which is which.
