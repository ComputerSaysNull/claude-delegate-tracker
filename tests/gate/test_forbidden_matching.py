"""Matching semantics for the local forbidden-strings list, pinned by test.

These were questions before they were tests: is matching case-sensitive, are substrings
caught, what happens to an entry containing a space. Answering them by reading the code
is how you end up confidently wrong, so each answer is asserted here and the file that
holds the literals documents the same rules.

Two gaps were found while pinning them down, both of which made a documented protection
weaker than it claimed:

  - The content scan used an allowlist of "text" extensions, so a literal in a .rst, .ts
    or .sql file passed silently. Fail-open, on a security check.
  - Commit messages were never scanned, although CLAUDE.md said they were. A message is
    the easiest place to leak a hostname, because you are describing the thing you were
    just debugging.
