"""Six gate checks that had never been shown to fire.

The second audit of 2026-08-27 found that `check_budgets`, `check_orphan_docs`,
`check_manifest_docs_exist`, `check_split_dodge`, `check_secret_paths` and `check_pr_text`
had no negative test. `test_gate_self_defeating_checks.py` covers the four checks that were
already caught validating nothing, by name; its docstring says both were found "by
negative-testing the gate rather than by reading it", which is exactly what these six had
never had. Two of them -- `check_pr_text` and `check_secret_paths` -- guard the surface
CLAUDE.md says no hook can gate.

Every check here is asserted in BOTH directions: that it fires on a real violation, and
that it stays silent on the closest thing that is not one. One direction alone is not a
test. A check that always fires passes a fires-on-violation test, and a check that never
fires passes a silent-on-clean test; only the pair distinguishes a working check from
either broken one.

`check_secret_paths` had exactly that half-test before this file: one case asserting it
does *not* flag the policy list. Nothing asserted it flags anything.

Two later checks join them here for the same reason. `check_env_example` and
`check_scan_coverage` were both written *because* something had been passing
unseen -- a deleted setting still advertised, and files the content scanners
declined to open -- so shipping either without a negative test would have
repeated the mistake that created them.

Named after the bug, per the project's convention.
