"""Install the git hooks. Idempotent, and safe to re-run.

The hook is a thin shim: it calls scripts/docs_gate.py so there is exactly one
implementation of the policy. A hook that reimplements the checks is a second copy that
will disagree with the first.

The gate runs at **commit-msg**, not pre-commit. git writes the message file only after
the pre-commit hook has returned, so a pre-commit run reads the PREVIOUS commit's message:
the host-identifier scan and the Docs-Gate-Skip waiver parser both judged text nobody was
proposing to commit. commit-msg is the first stage where the staged index and the real
message both exist, so it is the only stage where the whole check set is answerable.

Any stale pre-commit hook from an earlier install is removed, so the two cannot disagree.
