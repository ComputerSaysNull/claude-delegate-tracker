"""Derive a local stack of branches and print the commands that would publish its front.

This plans and does not publish. It reads git and GitHub and mutates neither, so it can be
run at any time, on any branch, without moving anything. Its predecessor did both, and the
half that published was invisible to the operator's hook: those pushes were subprocesses of
an already-approved script, where `PreToolUse` only ever sees a command run as a tool call.
Printing the commands instead puts each push, each `pr create` and each `pr merge` back in
front of that prompt.

**Only the front branch is planned**, because merging it invalidates everything behind it.
The merge is a squash, so it replaces the branch's commits with one new commit and the next
branch is still based on the OLD tip: a plain `git rebase main` then replays a commit whose
content is already upstream and conflicts on `CHANGELOG.md`, the one file every commit
touches. Every move is therefore `--onto <new parent> <old parent> <branch>` against tips
read before anything moved, which is exactly what goes stale the moment a merge lands. Run
this again after each merge. The old parent is the parent branch's old tip, never
`<branch>^`, so a branch of several commits keeps them all; for the front branch, whose
parent is gone, it is the squashed parent found by tree (`front_base`).

The stack is derived, never configured. A hardcoded order goes stale the moment a branch is
added, and it fails silently: the missing branch is simply not restacked and drifts behind
the rewritten history until a later rebase conflicts for no visible reason.

Two temporary files are written, for the pull request body and the gate payload, because a
body carrying newlines cannot go on a command line. Neither is in the repository and
neither reaches GitHub except as the text of the pull request the operator then approves.
The body is the front branch's newest CHANGELOG section plus a Verification section read
from `--verification <file>` -- never the commit body, which is shorter on purpose.
