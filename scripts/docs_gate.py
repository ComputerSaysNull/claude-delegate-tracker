"""One gate, two callers: a pre-commit hook and a CI job.

Same checks either way -- the hook gives fast feedback while you work, CI is the
authority that `--no-verify` cannot walk past. Keeping it one implementation is the
point; two copies of a policy is how the policy starts disagreeing with itself.

commit-message trailer, which is deliberately visible rather than silent:

    Docs-Gate-Skip: owning-doc -- pure rename, no behaviour change

Checks are added as the artefacts they police arrive. A check whose input does not exist
yet reports SKIP with the reason, rather than passing silently -- an invisible no-op
check is worse than an absent one, because it is trusted.
